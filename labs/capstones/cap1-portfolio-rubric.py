CAPSTONE 1 (ch1): The portfolio-readiness rubric.

Before you build a single project, you need to know what a hiring manager
actually screens for. The research is blunt: they screen for SHIPPED, EVALUATED,
end-to-end work with a real outcome, and a generic tutorial clone is a
disqualifying signal, not a neutral one. This lab turns that into a rubric you
can score any project spec against, so "is this portfolio-ready" stops being a
feeling and becomes a number.

The rubric weights six things a manager can verify in thirty seconds: is it
DEPLOYED (a live demo link), is it EVALUATED (real metrics, not a screenshot),
does it use a REAL corpus / real workflow (not a toy), does it have a
README-in-30-seconds, does it state a BUSINESS OUTCOME, and is it ORIGINAL
(not a renamed tutorial). Each project earns weighted points; the score is a
percentage; a project is portfolio-ready only if it clears the bar.

We score three specs: a hireable RAG assistant, a bare tutorial clone, and a
half-built project that works but was never evaluated or deployed. The lab
asserts the rubric ranks them correctly and gates on the bar, then prints the
success invariant and exits 0.
