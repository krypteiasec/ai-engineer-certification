CAPSTONE 6 (ch6): A self-red-teamed LLM app that attacks its own guardrails.

Capstone project five, and Ada's differentiator: an app that does not CLAIM it
is secure, it PROVES it by attacking itself on a schedule and scoring the result.
This is the security-course harness turned into one app that ships with its own
red-team suite. The app has guardrails (input sanitizing, output DLP, secret
isolation, an egress allowlist, and least-privilege tools) and a battery of
attacks mapped to the OWASP LLM Top 10 (direct injection, indirect/RAG poisoning,
system-prompt extraction, tool abuse, and sensitive-data exfiltration).

To prove the guardrails actually do something, the suite runs the SAME attacks
against the app with its defenses OFF and with them ON. Defenses-off should block
none; defenses-on should block all. That delta is the security report you publish,
and it is the portfolio piece that gets a security-leaning engineer hired. The lab
runs both passes, prints the report, and asserts the hardened app passes its own
suite, then prints the invariant and exits 0.
