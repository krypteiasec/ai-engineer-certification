CAPSTONE 7 (ch7): Packaging the portfolio, a manifest and README generator.

The projects are built. Now they have to be FOUND and UNDERSTOOD in thirty
seconds, because that is all the attention a screener gives. This final capstone
is the packaging layer: a small generator that takes a manifest of your finished
projects (the five capstones you just built) and emits, for each one, the
README-in-30-seconds a hiring manager actually reads, one that leads with the
business OUTCOME, links a live DEMO, names the METRICS, and lists the STACK.

It reuses the portfolio rubric from Capstone 1 as the acceptance test: every
generated README must contain the sections that make a project screenable, and
every manifest entry must be rubric-ready (deployed, evaluated, real, original).
The generator builds the portfolio index and the per-project READMEs, then asserts
each one passes the section check. It prints the invariant and exits 0.
